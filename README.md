## Overview

The Toronto Hotel Catering Management web application was developed using <strong>MVC pattern</strong> and <strong>.NET Core Entity Framework</strong>.
This project was developed using <strong>MVC pattern</strong> and <strong>.NET Core Entity Framework</strong> to create a catering management system for a hotel located in Toronto as a school project.

Model: A model class was created that represents the relationship between functions and customer objects and relationships with other objects such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. When creating, table relationships were defined in DbContext. A database containing constraints such as uniqueness.

Controller: Create each controller based on model object. Data flow between the client and server is controlled based on CRUD operations on objects. Business logic tailored to user needs was implemented and processed.

View (Page): Based on UI and UX, we provided the most suitable and user-friendly design for users. View design and layout can be maintained as long as there are no major changes to the business logic.
